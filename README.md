Author: Shawn Hoefert
Date: May - June 2023
üìå Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of Linux operating system fundamentals, focusing on essential command-line operations, system administration, and network configuration. It demonstrates practical skills in managing the Linux filesystem, creating and executing shell scripts, administering users and groups, configuring network interfaces, and monitoring system performance. This foundational knowledge is critical for cybersecurity professionals working with Linux-based servers and tools.
üéØ Key Objectives

    Linux Filesystem Mastery: Navigate, create, modify, and manage files and directories using command-line interface (CLI) commands.

    Shell Scripting: Develop, execute, and manage basic shell scripts for automation and task execution.

    User & Group Management: Administer user accounts and groups, including creation, modification, and removal, and understand associated permissions.

    Network Configuration: Discover, configure, and manage network interfaces and IP settings on a Linux system.

    System Monitoring: Monitor key system performance metrics, including processes, user activities, and network bandwidth usage.

    Command-Line Proficiency: Gain strong proficiency in essential Linux commands and utilities.

üîß Tools & Technologies

    Operating System: Ubuntu Linux (CLI and GUI environments)

    Command-Line Utilities: pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, locate, nano, chmod, useradd, groupadd, usermod, groupdel, userdel, tail, ipconfig, ping, dhclient, ifconfig, ps, top, htop, accton, lastcomm, nethogs (or similar network monitoring tools).

    Concepts: Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), Absolute vs. Relative Paths, File Permissions, PATH variable, Shell Scripting, User/Group IDs, DHCP, Network Interfaces, Process Management, System Accounting.

üîÑ Workflow & Modules Summary

This project was structured around several key modules, each building practical Linux administration skills:

    Linux Filesystem Hierarchy & Management:

        Objective: Navigated the Linux filesystem tree, created, copied, moved, and removed directories and files.

        Skills: pwd, cd, ls, mkdir, rm, cp, mv, locate commands, understanding of file paths.

    Shell Scripting Fundamentals:

        Objective: Created and executed basic shell scripts, managed file permissions, and configured the PATH variable for script execution.

        Skills: Script creation (nano), chmod for permissions, echo, PATH variable management, understanding of redirection.

    User and Group Management:

        Objective: Administered user accounts and groups via both command-line (useradd, groupadd, usermod, groupdel, userdel) and graphical user interfaces. Tested user and group settings.

        Skills: User/Group Administration, Permissions, Security Best Practices for user accounts.

    Network Configuration:

        Objective: Discovered host IP configurations, managed network interfaces, and utilized network utilities.

        Skills: ipconfig, ping, dhclient, ifconfig commands, understanding of IP addresses, default gateways, DHCP, and DNS.

    System Performance Monitoring:

        Objective: Monitored Linux processes, user activities, and network bandwidth usage.

        Skills: Process management (ps, top, kill), user activity tracking (accton, lastcomm), network monitoring, understanding of system resource utilization.

üíª Command Examples & Outputs

Below are examples of commands executed and their outputs, demonstrating practical Linux skills:
Shell Script Creation & Execution

student@ubuntu1:~$: nano todolist
# (Content of todolist script, e.g., for a simple to-do list application)
student@ubuntu1:~$: chmod 755 todolist
student@ubuntu1:~$: ls -l todolist
-rwxr-xr-x 1 student student 199 May 16 22:51 todolist
student@ubuntu1:~$: ./todolist
Enter today's to-do-list (Press ENTER to complete):
1. work. 2. family. 3. school.
You entered: 1. work. 2. family. 3. school.

User and Group Creation (CLI)

# Example commands used for user/group management:
# sudo useradd -m newuser
# sudo groupadd newgroup
# sudo usermod -aG newgroup newuser
# cat /etc/group | grep students
# students:x:1002:student,mary

Network Interface Configuration

student@ubuntu1:~$: ifconfig eth0
# (Output showing network interface details, e.g., IP address, MAC address)
eth0: flags=4098<BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500
